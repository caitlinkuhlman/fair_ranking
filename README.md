# fair_ranking

This repo contains scripts for testing 3 fairness criteria.

## data
This folder contains the raw data (i.e. .csv files) for our usage scenarios. PDF files within this folder are supporting evidence as to why this is a valid usage scenario.

## figures
This folder contains the resulting figures from the scripts for use in presentations and papers.

## papers
This folder contains machine learning and data manipulation literature as reference for developing our test scripts.

## scripts
This folder contains the .ipynb scripts used to test the fairness criteria. The modules/ subfolder contains .py modules used within the scripts.

Any .p files are cleaned data files for use by the scripts. They are generated by College_Fairness_Regression_Example.ipynb and calibration_football.ipynb (other scripts written later may also generate these files). They can safely be deleted or kept in the scripts file to allow for faster testing.
